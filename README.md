Made as a christmas gift for Claire.

This file contains the source files for two projects:
### 1: An express webserver
GET requests to the server respond with answers to the only two questions that need to be answered ever
- Is it raining? and/or
- Is it windy?

### 2: The "Is It Raining" Machine
An arduino powered box that when prompted, says whether it is raining and or if it is windy
